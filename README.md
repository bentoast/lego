# Lego Finder and Tracker
This is just a small scraper/display"er". We scrape Lego's site and get all new sets, find out what sets are retiring, price changes, etc.

Not only is that information sent in a digest every night, but there's also a small site where the information is displayed.

I can also mark which sets I have and which I want to explicitly keep track of.

It's not fancy, but it's honest work.
